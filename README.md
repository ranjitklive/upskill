## Get started

Read the [Deploy with Docker instructions](https://docs.upskill.io/deploy-docker) for the most comprehensive and up to date guide on installing and configuring upskill.

What you find below are minimal instructions to get you started as quickly as possible:

0. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
1. Create an empty folder
2. Inside that folder, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:
```
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:14.5
    environment: &db-env
      POSTGRES_USER: yourpostgresusername
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: yourpostgrespassword
    volumes:
      - dbdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  web:
    image: ranjitklive/upskill:latest
    environment:
      <<: *db-env
      BASE_URL: http://yourwebsite.com
      SECRET_KEY_BASE: yoursecretkeybase
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    
volumes:
  dbdata:
```
3. Edit the environment variables to fit your needs. You can find more information about env variables in the [documentation](https://docs.upskill.io/deploy-docker/#2-edit-environment-variables).
4. Run `docker compose pull && docker compose up`
5. You should now have a running instance of Astuto on port 3000. A default user account has been created with credentials email: `admin@example.com`, password: `password`.
